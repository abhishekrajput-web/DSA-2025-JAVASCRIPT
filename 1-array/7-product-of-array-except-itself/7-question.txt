 Problem Statement
You're given an array of integers.

You must return a new array output[] such that:

Each element at index i is equal to the product of all elements of the input array except nums[i].

Without using division.

üìå Test Case Example
Input:
js
Copy
Edit
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output:
js
Copy
Edit
[24, 12, 8, 6]
Why?
Output[0] = 2√ó3√ó4 = 24

Output[1] = 1√ó3√ó4 = 12

Output[2] = 1√ó2√ó4 = 8

Output[3] = 1√ó2√ó3 = 6

‚ö†Ô∏è Naive Approach (Using Division)
Take the total product of all elements.

For each index, divide total product by nums[i].

Example:
total = 1 √ó 2 √ó 3 √ó 4 = 24

result[i] = total / nums[i]

‚ùå Problems with this approach:
Fails when 0 is present (division by zero).

Not allowed if problem restricts using division.

Large numbers may exceed 2¬≥¬≤ (overflow).

üö´ Edge Case Failures
Division approach fails with:

Zeros in array ‚Üí incorrect or undefined.

Large product values ‚Üí exceeds 2¬≥¬≤ limit ‚Üí integer overflow.

‚úÖ Optimal Approach Without Division
Core Logic:
For each index i,
output[i] = product of all elements to the left of i √ó product of all elements to the right of i

üîÅ Step-by-Step Optimal Solution
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create two arrays:
left[]: product of all elements to the left of index i

right[]: product of all elements to the right of index i

2Ô∏è‚É£ Build left[] array (left to right):
js
Copy
Edit
left[0] = 1

for i = 1 to n-1:
    left[i] = left[i-1] * nums[i-1]
Example:
If nums = [3, 4, 6, 1, 2] ‚Üí
left = [1, 3, 12, 72, 72]

3Ô∏è‚É£ Build right[] array (right to left):
js
Copy
Edit
right[n-1] = 1

for i = n-2 to 0:
    right[i] = right[i+1] * nums[i+1]
Example:
right = [48, 12, 2, 2, 1]

4Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate Output Array:
js
Copy
Edit
output[i] = left[i] * right[i]
Final Output:

js
Copy
Edit
[48, 36, 24, 12, 72]  // Depending on the example input
‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n)

One pass for left[]

One pass for right[]

One pass for final output[]

Space Complexity: O(n)

Due to left[], right[], and output[]

‚úÖ Can be optimized to O(1) space (excluding output) by reusing the output[] array.

üß† Conceptual Insight
Avoid multiplication overflow by computing partial products instead of a single total.

Use prefix (left) and suffix (right) products to avoid division.

Think of the solution as left product √ó right product for each index.

üìö Why Interviewers Love This Question
Tests logical thinking more than coding skills.

Teaches you how to break problems into prefix and suffix patterns.

Encourages space optimization and careful edge-case handling (like zeros, large numbers).

‚úçÔ∏è Dry Run Summary
For input nums = [3, 4, 6, 1, 2]:

Left Products: [1, 3, 12, 72, 72]

Right Products: [48, 12, 2, 2, 1]

Final Output: [48, 36, 24, 12, 72]
‚Üí Each output[i] = left[i] * right[i]

üîÑ Final Code Concept (In JavaScript)
js
Copy
Edit
function productExceptSelf(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let left = Array(n).fill(1);
    let right = Array(n).fill(1);
    let output = Array(n).fill(1);

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        left[i] = left[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
    }

    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        right[i] = right[i + 1] * nums[i + 1];
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        output[i] = left[i] * right[i];
    }

    return output;
}
üîö Final Takeaway
"This problem is less about code and more about thinking logically in prefix & suffix terms. It‚Äôs a classic that tests problem-solving skills without diving into complex syntax."
