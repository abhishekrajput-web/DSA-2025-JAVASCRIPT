Complete Deep Summary of the Video (Point-wise Structured)
1. Problem Statement
Objective: Maximize profit from buying and selling a stock once (single transaction).

Input: Array of integers representing stock prices on consecutive days.

Example: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4] → Prices on Day 1, Day 2, etc.

Constraints:

Must buy before selling (no time travel).

If no profit is possible (e.g., prices always decrease), return 0.

2. Examples
Example 1:

Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]

Buy at 1 (Day 2), sell at 6 (Day 5) → Profit = 5 (max).

Example 2:

Input: [4, 3, 1]

Prices always drop → Profit = 0.

3. Brute Force Approach (Inefficient)
Method:

For each day (i), check all future days (j > i) to calculate profit (prices[j] - prices[i]).

Track the maximum profit found.

Drawback:

Time Complexity: O(n²) (nested loops).

Fails for large arrays due to high time consumption.

4. Optimal Solution (One-Pass Algorithm)
Intuition: Track the minimum buying price and update max profit in a single pass.

Steps:

Initialize:

min_price = prices[0] (buy price).

max_profit = 0.

Iterate through the array:

If current price < min_price → Update min_price.

Else, calculate current_profit = price - min_price.

Update max_profit if current_profit > max_profit.

Example Walkthrough:

Array: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]

Day 1: min_price=7, max_profit=0.

Day 2: Update min_price=1.

Day 3: Profit=4, max_profit=4.

Day 5: Profit=5, max_profit=5 (final answer).

Complexity:

Time: O(n) (single pass).

Space: O(1) (constant extra space).

5. Key Insights
Greedy Approach: Always seek the lowest buying price and highest selling price after buying.

Dynamic Programming: Memoizes the best possible profit at each step.

Edge Cases:

All decreasing prices → max_profit=0.

Single day → No transaction possible (profit=0).

6. Code Implementation (Pseudocode)
python
def maxProfit(prices):
    min_price = prices[0]
    max_profit = 0
    for price in prices:
        if price < min_price:
            min_price = price
        else:
            profit = price - min_price
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
    return max_profit
7. Variations & Advanced Problems
Multiple Transactions: Allowed to buy/sell multiple times (e.g., LeetCode "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II").

With Cooldown: Cannot buy immediately after selling.

With Transaction Fees: Deduct fee for each trade.

8. Practical Applications
Stock Trading: Real-world algorithmic trading strategies.

Financial Modeling: Analyzing historical data for trends.

9. Conclusion
Efficiency: Optimal solution avoids brute force by leveraging a single-pass greedy strategy.

Learning Path: Start with this problem, then tackle advanced variants (e.g., multiple transactions).
